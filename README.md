### `npm run scaffold <componentName>`

**Note: to create a react component. first you should change directory to src/components!**

Running this would create a component directory with the name passed and add 3 files same as the component name 
in that directory, for ex. 
`cd src/components`
`npm run scaffold App`
would create App folder and add 3 files, 
App.js (with default react component), App.css, App.spec.js (with default snapshot test)
